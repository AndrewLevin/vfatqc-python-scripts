[1mC. Testing the GLIB registers[0m
   Performing single and FIFO reads on the GLIB counters and ensuring they increment.

[1mE. Detecting the VFAT2s over I2C[0m
   Detecting VFAT2s on the GEM by reading out their chip ID.

VFAT2 connected at port 10 has the ID : 0xff20
VFAT2 connected at port 11 has the ID : 0xf6a4
VFAT2 connected at port 12 has the ID : 0xff58
VFAT2 connected at port 13 has the ID : 0xffd7
